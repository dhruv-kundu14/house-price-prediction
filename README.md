#Machine Learning Model

Algorithm Selection
Multiple Regression Analysis: Utilizing multiple regression analysis to model the relationships between various independent variables (e.g., property features, location, market trends) and the dependent variable (house price). This approach allows us to capture the complex interplay of factors influencing property values.
